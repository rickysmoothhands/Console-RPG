### Instructions
Over 8 days of lessons, we will create our Console RPGs. You are free to put whatever unique spin you want on the project as long as it meets the requirements of what we learn in class. As always, there are some extra credit pieces as well. In lessons, there will be things we don't go over, but I mention are things you still need to do in your Console RPG. This includes things like making sure the user does the right inputs and doesn't break the program. You will be expected to do these during Flex Time since you will be following along during lessons (unless you get ahead, in which case, of course you can do them ahead of time). Have fun!

### Grading Rubric
Your Console RPG must have 8 unique systems in the game, each outlined below. Once all are complete, you will have a finished game that you can play and show off to your friends! Each of the 8 unique systems contributes 15 points to your total score of 120 points on this assignment. You get the points if the system is fully functional, without bugs or glitches. Make sure to test your code! Also, each one has an extra credit opportunity listed below (the point values that start with a +).
